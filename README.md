# Shelf Picker Robot
The environment is a warehouse represented by a 6 by 6 grid. Each grid can either be empty (i.e. a passage that leads to a shelf) or is a shelf. There are 10 shelves in the warehouse, labelled A, B, â€¦, J. Each shelf contains a collection of items of a particular type. Thus, for example, shelf A contains multiple items of type A. The objective is to service customer orders through the use of a robot equipped with the agent software and hardware sensors that are mounted on the robot.
